# ddrScraper
A data scraper for shopping center properties owned by DDR

At my current startup we are doing data analysis on shopping centers. Rather than going through 350+ shopping centers owned by DDR, I just wrote a data scraper to pull them all into a csv.

Backlog:
Some data quality within cells.
Splitting some cells until multiple cells.
Handling encoding issues (HTML > string)
